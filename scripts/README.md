# LogLama Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help integrate LogLama into existing PyLama ecosystem components, migrate projects from various logging systems to LogLama, and fix linting and syntax issues in the codebase.

## integrate_loglama.py

This script helps you integrate LogLama into any component of the PyLama ecosystem. It will:

1. Create a `logging_config.py` module in the target component
2. Update `.env` and `.env.example` files with LogLama configuration
3. Create necessary directories (logs, etc.)

### Usage

```bash
# Integrate LogLama into a specific component
./integrate_loglama.py --component apilama

# Integrate LogLama into all components in the PyLama ecosystem
./integrate_loglama.py --all

# Specify a custom base directory
./integrate_loglama.py --all --dir /path/to/py-lama

# Generate a report without making any changes
./integrate_loglama.py --all --report-only
```

### Integration Status Report

The script can generate a comprehensive report of the LogLama integration status across all components using the `--report-only` flag. This is useful for checking which components have already been integrated and which ones still need work.

The report includes the following information for each component:

- Whether the component has a `logging_config.py` file
- Whether the component has a logs directory
- Whether the component's `.env` file includes LogLama configuration
- Whether the component's `.env.example` file includes LogLama configuration
- Overall integration status (fully integrated or not)

Example report output:

```
=== LogLama Integration Report ===

Component Status:

apilama         | ✅ Fully integrated
pybox           | ✅ Fully integrated
pyllm           | ✅ Fully integrated
pylama          | ✅ Fully integrated
shellama        | ✅ Fully integrated
weblama         | ✅ Fully integrated
```

### Integration Steps

After running the script, you'll need to update your component's main module to use LogLama. Add the following at the very top of your main module (before any other imports):

```python
# Initialize logging first, before any other imports
from your_component.logging_config import init_logging, get_logger

# Initialize logging with LogLama
init_logging()

# Now import other standard libraries
import os
import sys
# ... other imports

# Get a logger
logger = get_logger('your_module')
```

### Integrated Components

The following PyLama ecosystem components have been integrated with LogLama:

1. **APILama**: REST API gateway for the PyLama ecosystem
2. **PyBox**: Sandbox environment for executing code
3. **PyLLM**: LLM service for code generation
4. **PyLama**: Core component for the PyLama ecosystem
5. **ShellLama**: Shell command execution service
6. **WebLama**: Web interface for the PyLama ecosystem

You can check the integration status of each component using the `--report-only` flag as described above.

### Benefits of Using LogLama

1. **Early Environment Loading**: LogLama loads environment variables from `.env` files before any other libraries, preventing issues with incorrect configuration.

2. **Structured Logging**: LogLama provides structured logging capabilities, making it easier to search and analyze logs.

3. **Multiple Outputs**: Logs can be sent to console, files, SQLite database, and more.

4. **Context-Aware Logging**: Add context to your logs for better debugging.

5. **Consistent Interface**: All components use the same logging interface, making it easier to understand and maintain.

6. **Web Interface**: Access and filter logs through a convenient web interface using the `loglama web` command.

### Configuration

LogLama can be configured through environment variables in your `.env` file:

```
# LogLama configuration
COMPONENT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO                # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
COMPONENT_LOG_DIR=./logs               # Directory to store log files
COMPONENT_DB_LOGGING=true              # Enable database logging for advanced querying
COMPONENT_DB_PATH=./logs/component.db  # Path to SQLite database for logs
COMPONENT_JSON_LOGS=false              # Use JSON format for logs (useful for log processors)

# LogLama advanced settings
LOGLAMA_STRUCTURED_LOGGING=false        # Use structured logging with structlog
LOGLAMA_MAX_LOG_SIZE=10485760           # Maximum log file size in bytes (10 MB)
LOGLAMA_BACKUP_COUNT=5                  # Number of backup log files to keep
```

Replace `COMPONENT` with your component name (e.g., `APILAMA`, `WEBLAMA`, etc.).

## migrate_to_loglama.py

The migration script will:

1. Update import statements from `import loglama` to `import loglama`
2. Update module references from `loglama.xyz` to `loglama.xyz`
3. Update variable names containing `loglama` to use `loglama` instead
4. Update function calls like `loglama_get_logger()` to `loglama_get_logger()`
5. Update logger names (e.g., from "loglama_examples" to "loglama_examples")
6. Update environment variable references from `LOGLAMA_` to `LOGLAMA_`
7. Update configuration file names from `loglama_config.json` to `loglama_config.json`
8. Rename files and directories containing `loglama` in their names

### Migration Guide

For a comprehensive migration guide, see the [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) file in this directory.

### Compatibility Layer

If you need to maintain compatibility with both PyLogs and LogLama during a transition period, you can use the compatibility layer provided in `loglama.compat`.

```python
# Instead of importing directly from loglama or loglama
from loglama.compat import get_logger, setup_logging, LogContext

# Then use as normal
logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("This works with both PyLogs and LogLama!")
```

## universal_log_migrator.py

This script provides a comprehensive solution for migrating projects from various logging systems to LogLama. It supports multiple source logging systems and provides a unified interface for migration.

### Supported Logging Systems

- **Standard library logging**: Python's built-in logging module
- **Loguru**: A popular third-party logging library
- **structlog**: A structured logging library
- **Custom logging implementations**: Detects and migrates common custom logging patterns
- **PyLogs**: Uses the migrate_to_loglama.py script for PyLogs migration

### Usage

```bash
# Migrate from Python's standard logging module
python universal_log_migrator.py --path /path/to/your/project --source logging --verbose

# Migrate from Loguru
python universal_log_migrator.py --path /path/to/your/project --source loguru

# Migrate from structlog
python universal_log_migrator.py --path /path/to/your/project --source structlog

# Migrate from a custom logging implementation
python universal_log_migrator.py --path /path/to/your/project --source custom

# Migrate from PyLogs
python universal_log_migrator.py --path /path/to/your/project --source pylogs

# Run in report-only mode to see what would change without making any changes
python universal_log_migrator.py --path /path/to/your/project --source logging --report-only
```

### What It Does

The universal log migrator will:

1. Scan your project for files containing references to the source logging system
2. Update import statements to use LogLama
3. Convert logging configuration to use LogLama's setup_logging()
4. Update log method calls (debug, info, warning, error, critical)
5. Convert context handling to use LogLama's LogContext
6. Rename files and directories related to logging
7. Create a default logging_config.py if none exists
8. Update requirements.txt or pyproject.toml to include LogLama

### Migration Report

After running the migrator, a detailed report is generated showing all changes made. This report includes:

- Files modified
- Lines changed
- Types of changes (imports, configuration, log calls, etc.)
- Files and directories renamed
- New files created

The report is saved as JSON for easy parsing and can be viewed with any text editor or JSON viewer.
